Frequently asked questions
==========================

If anyone asked questions, the following ones would be frequent. I guess.


What's in a name?
-----------------

**Cogite** was born as an internal tool at Polyconseil. It was then a
single Python module creatively called "ghub". Because it would work
with GitHub and ``hub`` was already taken. Clever, isn't it?

While looking for a new name to conquer the world, I was reading one
of the Discworld novels. This is why Cogite comes from the first name
of a character in the French edition: Cogite Stibon. In the English
edition (as well as the German edition, apparently), the character is
named Ponder Stibbons, which does not contain "git" or anything
appropriate enough [#]_. So **Cogite** it is.

You may pronounce it "Cojeete" (as in French) or "Cog-it". Or "that
tool that's great". Really, I don't mind.


Merge strategy is superior to rebase and you MUST implement it

Did you not think of tag lines?
-------------------------------

I am so glad you asked. In no particular order:

- *Pull requests for Humans™*. I only lacked the name-dropping^W^W
  testimonials and could not quite yet list dozen of Fortune 500
  companies and shiny unicorns where someone someday used **Cogite**.

- *Take the power (of your pull requests) back*. Too mysterious,
  unless you are a fan of Rage Against The Machine. (Thinking about
  it, that could be a nice feature: play a random RATM song on each
  invocation of **Cogite**. And possibly "Never gonna give you up"
  from time to time.)

- *Live and die from your command line*. Too pompous and definitive.
  Slightly frightening. And, well, depressing.

- *Pull requests made simple*. Want more? *Cogite. And it's done.* Not
  enough? *Don't push only pull requests, push the limits!* Please
  someone stop me.



Should you not work on the other parts of the documentation instead of procrastinating here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no idea what you're talking about.



.. [#] Note that neither the Polish nor the Swedish editions would
       have helped, since the character is named "Myślak Stibbons" and
       "Grubblemus Stibbons" there respectively. I may use the latter
       for another project, though.
