Supported platforms
-------------------

As of now, **Cogite** supports GitHub only. Support for GitLab will
come soon.

Also, **Cogite** automatically detects and supports the following
continuous integration (CI) platforms: CircleCI and GitHub Actions.
If you use another platform, you need to configure **Cogite** (see
FIXME).
